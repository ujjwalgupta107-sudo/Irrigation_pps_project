Precision Irrigation Scheduler – PPS Mini Project (C Programming)

Semester 1 – Problem Solving & Programming in C (PPS)

This project is a console-based Precision Irrigation Scheduler designed to help farmers manage irrigation using soil moisture, crop type, rainfall, and water requirements.
It uses C programming concepts such as structures, pointers, arrays, dynamic memory, and modular programming.
Project Features:
- Add farm plots with crop details
- Update soil moisture (sensor simulation)
- Simulate rainfall
- Calculate water requirement
- Generate Daily & Weekly Irrigation Plans
- What-if simulation under limited water
- Event logging using a linked list
- Uses arrays, structures, pointers, dynamic memory, functions

Project Folder:
main.c
irrigation.c
irrigation.h

How to Run:
1. Install GCC Compiler (MSYS2 recommended)
2. Open folder in VS Code
3. Compile using: gcc main.c irrigation.c -o irrigation.exe
4. Run using: ./irrigation

Sample Menu:
1. Add Plot
